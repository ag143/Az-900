# Cost Management 

### Factors affecting Cost 

1. **Resource Type**
- `How you configure your resource`
For example, with a storage account you specify a type (such as block blob storage or table storage), a performance tier (standard or premium), and an access tier (hot, cool, or archive). These selections present different costs.

2. **Purchasing Services**
`The usage rates and billing period varies`
- enterprise customers (pay annually)
- web direct (pay monthly)
- CSP [Cloud Solutions Provider] ()
- free tier (with some 12 months free services + some credits to spend)
