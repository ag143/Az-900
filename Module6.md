# Cost Management 

### Factors affecting Cost 

1. **Resource Type**
- `How you configure your resource`
For example, with a storage account you specify a type (such as block blob storage or table storage), a performance tier (standard or premium), and an access tier (hot, cool, or archive). These selections present different costs.

2. **Purchasing Services**
`The usage rates and billing period varies`
- enterprise customers (pay annually)
- web direct (pay monthly)
- CSP [Cloud Solutions Provider] (Your CSP bills you for your Azure usage at a price they determine)
- free tier (with some 12 months free services + some credits to spend)

3. **Location**
`Azure is Globally distributed, but every region gives different Pricing`
You may choose a cheaper region but data transfer cost also applies. 

4. **Bandwidth**
`Data into Azure free; outside Costs money ðŸ’²ðŸ’µ`

5. **Reserved Instance**
`Prepay or commit your resource usuage... in turn you get huge discounts ðŸ¤‘`

6. **Hybrid use benefit**
