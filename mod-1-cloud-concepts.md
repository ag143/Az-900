IaaS is similar to take and bake — you don’t have to shop for separate ingredients, but you still have to heat the oven, set the table and clean up. One level up is delivery — no oven to heat, but you still have to figure out drinks and dishes. One additional level up is going out to a restaurant, which is similar to SaaS, where you have the least work and you’re paying someone else to wash the dishes.
